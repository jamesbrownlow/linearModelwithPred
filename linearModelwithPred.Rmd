Read about the data from the website where it is staged.  Then form three regression models; Model1 is SIMS~ARM, Model2 is SIMS~GRIP, and Model3 is SIMS~ARM+GRIP. For each model find a 95% prediction interval of SIMS given a value of 94  for GRIP and 88 for ARM. Compare Model1 with Model3 using anova. Write it up in a markdown document, push the project up to your github account and submit it back to canvas as link. 

 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
data <- read.csv(file="https://onlinestatbook.com/case_studies_rvls/physical_strength/data.txt",sep="",header=TRUE) 
```

```{r}
Model1 = lm(SIMS~ARM, data = data)
print(summary(Model1))
```

```{r}
plot(data$SIMS,data$ARM)
```
